\subsection*{How are these lifecycle phases affected?}
Answers: None; None; None; Implementation is affected when you need to fix errors or add new functionalities, which can complicate the code that is already there. Testing is impacted because it is necessary to redo old tests and create new ones, ensuring that the changes do not cause problems and that everything continues working well.; "Maintenance of the product is most significantly affected in the middle of the product development between the ""final"" implementation and testing. Maintenance by experience never has problems in the initial development cycle, because it is the phase with the most time and the least pressure from customers. Every project suffers from the creation of expectations by commercial areas, generating an unreal accumulated backlog, which later explodes in the project. So far every project I participated in suffered this, it is a constant in the industry.

Generally we want to add new tools, or new ways of working to work around problems. However, there is usually no more time, because all sectors of the companies become overloaded. And the sellers who sold the dream generally are no longer even working at the company."; None; None; Maintenance has a direct impact on the phase.; None; None; None; None; "Planning – If code maintenance is not taken into consideration it affects the other areas generating rework;
Requirements – functional requirements of the application must be taken into consideration.
Design – When modeling the embedded system, the proposed architecture must be considered, which should be easy to maintain, scalable, and make the addition and refactoring of modules simpler, avoiding excessive software coupling.
Implementation – When implementing, one must respect the architecture proposed in the system Design."; all phases are directly or indirectly affected; None; None; Maintenance may require updates or reconfiguration in the embedded software and requires that the test plans be reviewed to ensure coverage.; None; None; None; Changes in requirements may require revisions in the design, such as modifying the architecture or adding new components, interfaces, or modules to the system. Bug fixes, performance improvements, or adding new functionalities may lead to significant modifications in the source code. Each change in code or architecture requires test review and re-execution. Embedded software, in particular, must be tested in real environments to ensure it functions correctly with the hardware.
The integration of new functionalities may require adjustments in the design to ensure that the software continues to operate efficiently and safely, especially in systems with strict resource constraints. The process of distributing and installing updates may be affected by communication or hardware limitations, requiring new methods to deploy without affecting continuous operation.; None; None; None; None; Little information; None; Code maintenance itself affects testing and some implementation modes; however, if maintenance generates architectural or general changes, then it impacts implementation, design, and may even lead to system decommissioning; None; None; None; Unplanned application downtime; The maintenance process often involves unexpected issues, requiring adjustments in all phases of the software lifecycle. I do not see embedded software development as a linear process. When hardware and software are integrated, development becomes cyclical due to the difficulty of predicting all limiting factors, requirements, and other variables. However, I speak from an academic perspective; in industry this may certainly be different.; Defining a Sustainability Plan is very important; therefore, all previous phases plus the retirement phase of the system generate some impact on maintenance. Thus, they are affected in some way.; The entire lifecycle of an embedded system must be analyzed so that maintaining it and adding new functionalities is simple and avoids problems, so from planning and requirements gathering it is fundamental to ensure a long useful life of the designed system..

\subsection*{What are the main challenges during the planning of embedded software maintenance?}
Answers: Resource allocation; Forecasting future issues, Coordination between teams, Integration of new technologies; Forecasting future issues, Resource allocation, Requirements identification; Forecasting future issues, Coordination between teams, Integration of new technologies; Forecasting future issues, Resource allocation, Requirements identification, Coordination between teams, Integration of new technologies, As mentioned earlier, all problems are linked to expectations created, which are never transparently communicated to the development and architecture team.

Answers: Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes, Increased collaboration, Reduction of rework; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes, Reduction of rework; Agile methodology is just another methodology. I have already worked with agile methodology in a way that worked, and I have already seen it not work (in reality, most of the time it fails). It depends a lot on team size, project scope, project architecture, pressure, available tools, company culture, and even country culture. Today we do not work with agile methodology for some reasons, one of them being to ensure the psychological health of employees. We do not work with short deliveries, but with annual milestones, and employees have greater freedom, without following any specific ritual.; Greater flexibility, Reduction of rework; Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Increased collaboration, Reduction of rework; Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Increased collaboration; Better response to changes, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes, Reduction of rework; Greater flexibility; Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes, Reduction of rework; Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Better response to changes; Greater flexibility; Better response to changes; Better response to changes, Reduction of rework; Increased collaboration, Reduction of rework; Better response to changes; Reduction of rework; Currently I see it more as metrics, flexibility is reduced and collaboration is little measured by scrum; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Greater flexibility, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes; Better response to changes, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Early identification of defects/errors/failures; Better response to changes, Increased collaboration; Greater flexibility, Better response to changes.
